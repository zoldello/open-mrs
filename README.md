# openmrs_data_demo

## Purpose
This code is a demo of Openmrs data, for CHOP


## Instructions on how code was set up

Data Section
This section consists of short exercises in analysis of a relational health-related database in SQLite, downloadable from here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mgu1s93kpjsoyhh/openmrs.db?dl=0

This database is a processed version of the public data set for a specific instance of a query tool. The original open MRS data model can be found here: https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Data+Model. The solutions should be done on the data in SQLite database provided. You can convert it to a database flavor of your choice, but again, explain your choice.

Key tables include:

patient
encounter
encounter_diagnosis
diagnosis
Please provide both the data result as well as any code that was run to obtain the result.

Data Exercise 1
Provide a list of male patients in the database and the counts of patients by gender.

Data Exercise 2
